DISCRIPTION :

This project focuses on the development of a simple Decentralized Finance (DeFi) application that enables users to lend and borrow digital assets without relying on any centralized authority. The main objective of this project is to understand the core concepts of DeFi, smart contracts, and blockchain-based financial systems using Ethereum and Solidity. The application is designed to be beginner-friendly while still demonstrating real-world DeFi functionality.

The DeFi lending pool smart contract allows users to deposit Ether (ETH) into a shared pool. These deposited funds act as liquidity, which other users can borrow from. Once a user deposits ETH, the contract securely holds the funds and records the transaction on the blockchain. This ensures transparency and trust, as all transactions are immutable and publicly verifiable.

Borrowing is another key feature of the application. A user can borrow ETH from the pool as long as sufficient liquidity is available. When a user borrows funds, the smart contract calculates interest dynamically based on a predefined interest rate. The interest rate is set by the contract owner and represents the cost of borrowing. The total debt includes both the borrowed amount and the calculated interest, ensuring that lenders are incentivized to provide liquidity.

Repayment functionality allows borrowers to repay their loans along with the interest. The contract verifies that the repayment amount is sufficient before accepting the transaction. Once the repayment is completed, the borrower’s debt is cleared. This automated process eliminates the need for intermediaries, making the system efficient and trustless.

The smart contract also includes an owner role to manage administrative functions such as setting the interest rate and withdrawing excess funds from the pool. Ownership control ensures that only authorized actions can modify sensitive parameters, improving the security of the application. The use of Solidity’s built-in safety features ensures protection against common issues such as arithmetic overflows and unauthorized access.

This project was implemented and tested using the Remix IDE and the Remix Virtual Machine (VM), which provides a safe testing environment with pre-funded accounts. Multiple test transactions such as deposit, borrow, and repay were performed to verify the correctness of the contract. Successful execution of these transactions demonstrates that the smart contract behaves as expected.
